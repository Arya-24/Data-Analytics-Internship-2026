# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. 
The objective is to identify factors influencing employee turnover and build predictive machine learning models.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix)

## Key Findings
- Overtime strongly impacts attrition.
- Lower income employees show higher attrition rates.
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest overall accuracy.
- Random Forest achieved higher recall for attrition cases, making it more suitable for identifying employees at risk of leaving.

## Status
✅ Completed – Week 1 Internship Project
